# DarkMarket
DarkMarket is a walletless darknet market Established 2019 We only offer support on the market!
DarkMarket (Dark Market) is currently the best darknet market on Tor.

DarkMarket  is an increasingly popular darknet market that accepts Bitcoin (BTC)  and Monero (XMR) and features over 125,000 product listings. It appears  to be centered primarily on a European customer base but does feature  vendors in the U.S. as well. Globally-speaking, it operates just about  everywhere around the world, with two notable exceptions being Russia  and UAE.

DarkMarket’s purchase  system works a bit different from most other darknet markets as it does  not feature user wallets with account balances hosted by the market.  Instead of drawing funds from an account balance to make a payment, each  purchase generates a unique deposit address, which reduces the  potential for monetary loss to one order at a time.

The  market’s search engine isn’t the best, the filtering system has a few  problems, and it doesn’t seem like the market has many vendors or  customers from the U.S. On top of that, there are a lot of negative  reviews floating around from customers getting scammed by vendors, and  in some instances, the market itself. Whether or not the latter of these  allegations are true is unknown, but DarkMarket does stress the  importance of making sure you are always visiting an official URL as  their users are frequently the victims of phishing websites on scam  URLs.

There’s no way to know for  sure that DarkMarket is here to stay - at least for a while - so it is  recommended to start out with smaller purchases before getting  comfortable making larger ones. With a simple account creation process, a  special emphasis on customer service and a sizeable collection of  experienced vendors, the market has managed to attract a lot of  customers in its 16 months of service and appears to be as good a  darknet market as any when it comes to overall selection of product  listings.

# Before Getting Started

Using  a darknet market like DarkMarket requires some basic knowledge in a few  different areas related to cryptocurrency, encryption, and basic  security practices. Before creating an account and attempting to make a  purchase on DarkMarket, we recommending having at least a basic  understanding of the following subjects:
- How to send and receive BTC or 	XMR
- How to buy and sell BTC or XMR
- How to generate a PGP public/private key pair, encrypt and decrypt messages
- How to safely secure sensitive information
- How to use a Tor browser

Also,  don’t forget to turn off JavaScript if you have it enabled in your Tor  browser (DarkMarket will remind you of this upon visiting their site).  You can do this by clicking on the “S” to bring up “NoScript” options  and making the site an “untrusted” site. Refreshing the tab will block  JavaScript from running on the page.
One  of the first things that you’ll need to do before opening an account is  make sure you are visiting a valid URL. DarkMarket frequently suffers  from DDOS and phishing attacks and for that reason it is a good idea to  make sure you are visiting a most recent, correct URL when attempting to  register at or visit the market.

The best way to find valid URLs for DarkMarket is to use the official link -

Trying  to get links from a search engine is generally a bad idea and it is  better to only use trusted, verifiable sources. You may be asked to put  two parts of a TOR URL together in order to access a valid mirror of the  market -- a tactic DarkMarket uses to slow down DDOS attacks.
How to Create an Account at DarkMarket
After  making sure you have landed at a valid URL, press the “Sign Up” button  in the upper right corner of the screen. The sign up process requires  that you provide a user name, password, and fill in a captcha. Upon  doing this, your account will be created, and you will be brought to a  screen with a 24-word mnemonic that looks something like this:

Be  sure to save these words somewhere secure and where you won’t forget as  you will need them to recover your account if you happen to lose access  to it. After creating your account, you will be logged in to the market  and see its home page:

Although  your account has officially been created and you are free to browse the  market, there are a few things you’ll need to take care of before  attempting to make a purchase. First, hover over your account name on  the right side of the menu bar and select “Settings”. You’ll notice that  DarkMarket has provided you with your own custom URL links, which are a  great way to keep track of valid URLs that can be stored and used for  future logins.
A few sections  below on the Settings page you’ll notice there is an option for Two  Factor Authentication which can be set by entering your PGP public key  in field below. It should look something like this when correctly  filled:

After  pasting your PGP public key, click the blue “Add PGP Key” button below  the text field. This will cause the screen to refresh with a message  encrypted with your PGP key. Within the message is a Validation number  that you will need to copy from the unencrypted version of the message  provided by DarkMarket. A successfully decrypted message will read  something like:
“You have successfully decrypted this message. To validate this key please copy validation number to the field on the site
Validation number:127157513817”

After  copy/pasting the Validation number and pressing the “Validate” button,  you will be notified that your PGP key has successfully been changed.  This will allow you to toggle the Two Factor Authentication to “On”,  which can be located directly above the PGP key text field. It will also  allow you to receive encrypted communications from vendors and buyers.
Another  thing you’ll need to do while you’re in Settings is enter in a refund  address. This will be either a BTC or XMR address, depending on what  coin you are using to make your payment. Do this by entering an address  in the space below the “Crypto Addresses” field, which is below the PGP  key information.
After configuring your Two Factor Authentication, PGP and refund address, you’re now ready to start using the market.
Finding a Product Listing

# DarkMarket’s  product categories 
can be found on the left side of the screen. The  list of categories (and subcategories) includes the following:

- Digital / Physical
- Category
- Minimum price / Maximum price
- Ships from / Ships to
- Newest, Price, Most Experience Points, 5 Star Product/Communication/Shipping, Trusted Vendor

Pro  Tip: In this day and age, it’s a good idea to only place orders from  vendors within your country when possible, as this prevents the need for  international travel and thus additional scrutiny.
Before Making a Purchase
Keep  in mind that DarkMarket doesn’t host user wallets with balances  associated with their accounts. Instead, a new address is created  representative of each transaction.

It’s  also a good idea to keep in mind that reputation is everything when it  comes to successful experiences with darknet markets. It is recommended  to only deal with vendors that have impeccable reputations when  possible. A vendor’s reputation information can be seen right under  their name on all their products listings, which shows the number of  positive, neutral and negative reviews a vendor has receive.
Vendors who are reported as having more problems than average are marked with a warning label, such as can be seen below:

Take  the time to read the vendor’s feedback before making a purchase. This  can be found by clicking the “Feedback” tab beneath the product order  screen. If a product has no feedback, click the vendor name at the top  right of the product listing to go to their home page at DarkMarket.  Here, you can see the XP earned by the vendor (positive is good,  negative is bad), their PGP key, and feedback ratings. It is recommended  that you also read individual ratings by clicking “See all feedback” on  the right.

When offered a choice  between vendors who may be competing for your business, be sure to  always choose the vendor with the highest overall trust scores,  including net positive reviews, XP, and high marks in Quality, Shipping  and Communication. It’s also recommended to seek out more experienced  vendors whose clients leave nothing but satisfied comments. Don’t bother  dealing with reported scammers or inept vendors, even if their prices  are lower than everybody else’s. You’ll usually end up wasting your time  at best and losing your funds at worst.
Making a Purchase on DarkMarket

DarkMarket  supports both Bitcoin (BTC) and Monero (XMR) as deposit options. It is  pretty much recommended to transact in XMR when possible as funds can be  moved more anonymously and it will make it harder to trace your sent  funds back to you. The only downside of XMR on the market is that not as  many vendors will accept it as a payment option, and thus your  selection of purchasable products may be diminished.
After  finding the product you wish to purchase, click on it (or the “Buy Now”  button underneath) to bring up the listing’s details. Here, you will  see the following vendor-defined options for the listing:
- Escrow options (Regular, Finalize Early)
- Payment options (BTC and/or XMR)
- Shipping options (Regular, Priority, Express, etc.)

After  setting the following 3 options for your order, enter the quantity of  the item you wish to purchase, and click the “add” button below. You  will be brought to the order placement screen where you can review your  order and enter the address to which you want the product shipped. Text  in the address field will be automatically encrypted using the vendor’s  public key, which means you do not need to perform this step for your  communication to be encrypted.

If  you are satisfied with the order details and the address you have  provided, click the “Checkout” button -- unless you have multiple items  in your shopping cart to review; in which case press the “Next” button  on the right side of the screen to proceed to the next item. You will  then be brought to the checkout screen where you can review your order  one more time. Press “Purchase” to confirm the order.
After  confirming your purchase, you will be brought to the payment screen.  Beneath the order information will be a section with payment  information, alongside the encrypted address message sent to the vendor.  Here you can see the exact amount of BTC or XMR that needs to be sent  in order for your order to be marked as “paid.” Beneath that will be a  payment address. After the payment has been confirmed by the coin’s  network, the vendor will be notified of the order and start preparing it  for delivery.

If  you want to change your mind about an order, this is the best time to  do it: simply hit “Cancel purchase” and the order will be removed.
Orders have 5 statuses:
- Purchased (payment has been received)
- Sent (product has been mailed by the vendor)
- Delivered (product has been received by the buyer)
- Disputed (product delivery or quality disputed by the buyer)
- Canceled (order cancelled by buyer or seller)
You  can keep track of your order a number of ways, including selecting the  “Purchases” drop-down option from the menu tab with your account name.
Pro  Tip: If an article is late, quite often you will have the chance to  extend the deadline before it is finalized. Just keep in contact with  the vendor and let him know when you have received your product (don’t  forget to encrypt all post-order conversation with the vendor using the  PGP key)

# Finalizing Your Order

There  are only two types of escrow that can be used on DarkMarket: Normal  Escrow and Finalize Early (FE). Selecting Normal Escrow means that you  will have to finalize your order after receiving it in order for your  funds to be released to the vendor. This can be done from the order  page, found by hovering over your account name tab and selecting  “Purchases” from the drop-down menu.
If  you are unsatisfied with the quality of your order, you can also submit  a dispute from the order page which will give you a chance to let  DarkMarket operators know what is wrong with your purchase. The dispute  resolution team will then reach out to the vendor in an attempt to  mediate and gather information. If the team finds in favor of you, your  payment will be refunded to your refund address. If the team finds in  favor of the vendor, the funds will be released to the vendor.
The  second escrow option, Finalize Early, is only made available to vendors  who have proven their trustworthiness and ability to carry out smooth  business on the forum. This will release funds to the vendor  immediately. Only use this escrow option if you have complete confidence  in the vendor’s ability to fill your order.
Other  orders will auto-finalize after a certain amount of time, as ordinarily  it is assumed the order went according to plan if there is no objection  from the buyer. The time before auto-finalization can be extended from  the order page if an order is taking an inordinately long amount of time  to arrive. Even though DarkMarket advertises themselves as having a  great customer support team, it is better to avoid the hassles of the  dispute resolution process when possible, even if it means exhibiting an  extra amount of patience or understanding.

# Conclusion

In  all, DarkMarket is a decent market for those willing to be a bit on the  adventurous side, as it does not inspire an overwhelming amount of  confidence in terms of security or forthrightness. It has, however,  managed to attract tens or ever hundreds of thousands of customers over a  relatively short period of time, many of which followed vendors from  markets that are no longer in operation. The fact that they don’t  maintain customer funds in accounts is a bit trust inspiring but it  hasn’t stopped similar “wallet-less” escrow schemas from exit scamming  their customers in the past.
So  long as one has a basic understanding of cryptocurrency transfer and  PGP, they should be able to have a successful experience on DarkMarket;  especially if they follow basic principles like only buying from  reputable vendors and starting off with smaller purchases. It’s  important to remember that this type of market can be extremely risky to  operate or participate in, and paying attention to one’s own security  will forever be more important than getting in on what appears to be a  good deal.
